Hello Dan 

Task1 
It is pretty simple and id did not take much time complete.

Task2

I guess my ubuntu has messed up files from different versions so when i am trying to install 
Mailutils it wont work.
So i have just written the command for that


Task3

i have managed to run the httpd24 server which has apache 2.4.X running on it.

Task4 

Was able build two docker images which run sql and was able to do master master replication between them. 
all of the debug and inputs part is present in the rundocker_log.sh
i should have used docker compose but i am not well versed in it so i was not able to do this complicated exercise

MY Views
1) Before this assesment i have never used bash and Know very little of Docker.
2) this assingment has made me cross my horizon and i think i did good. 

Overall this was a great learning experience.

Hope to hear from you soon

thank you
